## About Kanan

I am a public sector technology leader from Azerbaijan, with a strong focus on digital transformation and innovation. I currently serve as the Director of the DOST Digital Innovation Center under the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Population (MLSPP). My work revolves around building inclusive, efficient, and future-ready public services using digital tools and data-driven approaches.

I earned my bachelor's degree in Informatics & Management from Azerbaijan State University of Economics in 2012, followed by a master's in Information Systems from Baku State University in 2014. 

Since then, I’ve taken on increasingly strategic roles in government—leading ICT infrastructure, managing e-services development, and now directing national-level innovation projects that impact millions of citizens.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies, contributing to civic tech initiatives, and spending quality time with my family. I'm married and a proud father of two.
